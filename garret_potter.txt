Garret Potter is developing Everstory--the encyclopedia exploration environment for early learners. 

Everstory is like an audio/visual Wikipedia web app for four-year-olds who do not yet read text. 
Everstory is a 501(c)3 non profit company in its development phase. 
Using open source tools, UMSI and UM School of Education training, Garret Potter and volunteer collaborators are working 
to help early learners explore their curiosity independently.
