As a father of two children (ages 9 and 2), a former preschool teacher and Kindergarten teacher, 
and dual-degree master's student at the University of Michigan (M.A.Ed '22 & M.S.Info '25), 
Garret Potter is developing Everstory--the encyclopedia exploration environment for early learners. 

Everstory is like an audio/visual Wikipedia for four-year-olds who do not yet read text. 
Conceived in 2021 and founded in 2022, Everstory is a 501(c)3 non profit company in its development phase. 
With UMSI and UM School of Education training, Garret Potter and volunteer collaborators are using open-source tools 
to develop a mobile friendly web application to help early learners explore their curiosity independently.
